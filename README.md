### Overview

We propose a novel partition method for reliable feature-aligned quadrangulation. The core insight of the partition is that smooth streamlines distant from singularities are more suitable as patch boundaries. This allows singularities to be enclosed within patches, resulting in straighter patch boundaries and reducing the distorting influence of singularities. Accordingly, we introduce a new patch quality control mechanism that keeps the patch boundaries inside regions with high field smoothness. Combined with other common metrics (e.g., aligning boundaries with field and feature lines), we develop a practical partition algorithm that first iteratively traces paths in field smoothness-controlled regions to form patches and then removes redundant paths to simplify the patch layout. We demonstrate the effectiveness and practicability of our partitions by using them to generate quality quad meshes on a massive test data set. Compared with state-of-the-art methods, our approach produces quad meshes with significantly enhanced quality while maintaining similar reliability, validating the core insight.

## Installation

To install this project on a Unix-based system, use the following standard CMake build procedure:

```bash
git clone https://github.com/AnderLiang/Field-Smoothness-Controlled-Quadrangulation.git
```

This project depends on CoMISo, glog, and Gurobi.

CoMISo official website: https://www.graphics.rwth-aachen.de/software/comiso/

glog official website: https://github.com/google/glog

Gurobi official website: https://www.gurobi.com/

We have provided precompiled libraries (libCoMISod.so and libglog.so) in the bin directory, but it is still recommended to install these dependencies manually.
For academic use, Gurobi provides a free academic license, which you can apply for and install locally.

## Usage
```bash
./mkdir.sh
```
The input mesh must be a manifold surface. Add it to the `/data/input` directory, and then execute:
```bash
cd bin
./fscq.sh -a 0 6
./analyse_result.sh 0 0 0
```


The final results can be viewed in the `/data/post_process` directory, and static analysis results are located in the `/data/result_analysis` directory.

If you want to use the 8700 dataset's models, you can add the .obj and the .sharp file to `/data/origin` directory, and then execute:
```bash
cd bin
./fscq.sh -a 1 6
./analyse_result.sh 0 0 0
```
